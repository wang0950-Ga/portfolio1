Introduction
Hi~I'm appriciate this assignment so I can review lots of knowledge I learned from this and last term.

At the beginning of the design, I made some changes to some conventional regulations. For example, give up using the hamburger button.Add some user-friendly elements such as quick browsing, etc.

I also try to use graphics to replace large paragraphs of introductory text. So with the knowledge I have at this stage, I have indeed encountered some challenges.

Approach:

For these reasons, I think just using bootstrip may not be enough for me. I still need to write my own CSS. And the breakpoint I chose is rather special. In the final version, my vision is to have 4 media queries.

Because based on different sizes, the cards and content are different. The reason why I did this is that I wanted this assignment to allow me to fully practice my existing skills as much as possible.

But for navigation, I personally think that relatively simple web pages and menu buttons do not need to be hidden on the mobile terminal. Arranging them in a position that is familiar to users will make it more convenient for users to operate. Because this design will reduce the click operations of mobile users. For users using smaller screen devices, actions such as clicking, dragging, and copying are the operations that users are least willing to perform.

Challenges:

The challenge is still responsive design, I spent a lot of time in this direction. Because during design, the layout of cards, timelines, and some pictures displayed on different types of devices is completely different. In terms of time, I am more familiar with personal CSS than bootstrip at this stage.

Another challenge is the clipboard. I guess I didn't find it in bootstrip. But I still found the code, but I am still making adjustments to this code.


Overall, this page did not encounter any obstacles that would make me unable to proceed. The biggest problem for me is spending too much time on the choice of method. It is possible to find a better way or to adjust the code that has been written before. But I think this phenomenon will gradually get better with time and the accumulation of knowledge and experience.

Lessons Learned: 

The biggest gain is actually that I want to try to show all the knowledge I have learned. In addition, this is also the first page to use bootstrip in the true sense, which is really convenient. And in the process of using it, I also gained a deeper understanding of bootstrip. The most important thing is that in order to realize some functions, I came into contact with JS in advance during the coding process. This is also the most exciting place. 

Results and Achievements:

I've always thought of practices like this as almost addictive to me. Because in order to solve problems, you can learn about unknown areas, repeat previous knowledge, and constantly switch problem-solving perspectives to get better feedback, this time is extremely worthwhile.
